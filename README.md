# Databricks Examples

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of Databricks for processing and analyzing data, with a focus on structuring unstructured genomic data using advanced AI techniques. Databricks offers a unified platform for data engineering, collaborative data science, full lifecycle machine learning, and business analytics through a user-friendly interface.

## Advantages of Using Databricks

Databricks provides several advantages for data scientists and engineers:

- **Unified Platform**: Integrate data engineering, data science, machine learning, and analytics in a single platform to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration.
- **Scalability**: Leverage the scalability of the cloud to process large datasets efficiently with automatic resource management and optimization.
- **Managed MLflow**: Includes MLflow for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.
- **Delta Lake**: Ensures reliability, quality, and performance of data lakes.

## New Functionality: AI-driven Structuring of Unstructured Data

Databricks enhances its capabilities with AI to automatically structure unstructured data. This feature uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify, categorize, and transform unstructured data into a structured format, making it ready for analysis and insights. This capability is particularly valuable in genomic data analysis, where it can identify and extract useful information from complex, unstructured text sources.

## Using Databricks to Structure Genomic Data

In this repository, we demonstrate how Databricks can be used to automatically extract and structure genomic information from unstructured text. This involves using natural language processing to parse and identify genomic entities and relationships, followed by feature engineering and machine learning to structure the data.

### Steps to Use Databricks for Genomic Data

1. **Preprocess Text Data:**
   - Utilize libraries like `nltk` or `spaCy` for natural language processing to clean and prepare text data.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Convert text data into numerical formats suitable for machine learning, using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

3. **Machine Learning Model Training:**
   - Employ Databricks AutoML to train and tune models automatically, identifying the best model for classifying or predicting genomic features.

4. **Model Evaluation and Deployment:**
   - Use MLflow to manage the machine learning lifecycle, tracking experiments, and deploying models to production.

5. **Visualization and Analysis:**
   - Analyze and visualize structured data and model predictions to derive genomic insights.
